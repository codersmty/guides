Improve Queries Performance with PostgreSQL
===================

####Improving query performance involves the following topics:
 1. Knowing the types of indexes in PG and their use cases.
 2. Use Explan and Analyze to dig into query execution plans.
 3. Aggreation and subsets of tables beforing applying joins.
 4. Be aware of retrieving only the columns you need from your tuples.


Indexes in PostgreSQL
-------------

#### B-Tree index, is the most common type of index, it is used in the following cases:

- Primary keys (each primary key is by default a unique b-tree index)
- Foreign keys (you must create a unique b-tree index for each foreign key)
- Improves performance on operations like >, <, >=, <=, =
- Searching with LIKE operator for strings that start with: LIKE pattern%    

```sql
# How to create a B-Tree index:
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index_name ON table_name column_name
DROP INDEX index_name

# Examples that benefit form a B-Tree index:
# Searching by a primary key
SELECT * from users where user.id = 1

# Joining tables via a foreign key
SELECT * from users INNER JOIN addresses ON users.id = addresses.user_id

# Search pattern with ilike, like hello%
SELECT * from users where ilike 'arm%'

# Search with >, <, >=, = operators
SELECT * from orders where total > 1000
SELECT * from orders where status = 'complete''
```

#### GIN index, specially aimed for FTS or searching inside composite values (jsonb, hstore...):
- Best for static data lookups
- Slower to create/update
- Supports operators on one-dimensional arrays
- Improves performance on operations like: ilike '%pattern%' and FTS with addons like trigram, unaccent...

```sql
# On a non ts_vector you must activate trgm extension for fast searches with
# similarity (sinonyms) or like, ilike operators.
 
# How to activate/deactivate pg_trgm extension
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
DROP EXTENSION pg_trgm;
 
# How to create/drop a GIN index:   
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name USING  GIN(column_name gin_trgm_ops)
DROP index_name

# Examples that benefit from a GIN index:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email ILIKE '%juan@g%'
```

#### GIST index, specially aimed for FTS and Two-dimension geometrical data types:
- Best for dynamic data lookups
- Faster to create/update
- Supports operators on two-dimensional geometric data types and location
- Improves performance on operations like: ilike '%pattern%' and FTS with addons like trigram, unaccent...

```sql
# On a non ts_vector you must activate trgm extension for fast searches with
# similarity (sinonyms) or like, ilike operators.
 
# How to activate/deactivate pg_trgm extension
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
DROP EXTENSION pg_trgm;
 
# How to create/drop a GIST index:   
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name USING  GIST(column_name gist_trgm_ops)
DROP index_name

# Examples that benefit from a GIST index:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email ILIKE '%juan@g%'
```

#### Partial indexes, specially aimed to create portions of a dataset:
- Useful in situations when you want to access a subset of your table under specific filters.
- Are marked by specific conditions where total > 1000, where state = 'complete'.

```sql
 
# How to create/drop a Partial index:
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name) WHERE CONDITION
DROP index_name

# Unique composite index with 2 colums and 1 condition
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tests_success_constraint ON tests (subject, target) WHERE success = true;

# Partial index where order_nr is not true
CREATE INDEX orders_unbilled_index ON orders (order_nr) WHERE billed is not true;

# Examples that benefit from a Partial index:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE billed is not true AND order_nr < 10000;
SELECT * FROM tests WHERE subject = 1 AND target = 2 WHERE success = true;
```

#### Multi-column indexes, specially aimed for queries requiring 2 or more columns regularly:

- Useful in situations when you want to access a subset of your table according to the a condition applied to 2 colums.
- A query using order_id = 1 AND state='complete' will have the benefits of this kind of index

```sql
# How to create/drop a Multi Column index:
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_one_name, column_two_name)
CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 (major, minor);

# Examples that benefit from a Multi Column index:
SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = 'math' AND minor = 'music';
```
